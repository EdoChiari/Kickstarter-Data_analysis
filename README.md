# Kickstart Analysis SQL-Project 

### Introduction to Kickstarter Data Study

This study focuses on analyzing Kickstarter project data to extract insights related to trends, performance, and key characteristics within the crowdfunding ecosystem. By leveraging SQL queries, various aspects such as the distribution of project outcomes, participation of backers across different countries, success rates by category, and financial goals are explored.

The dataset provides detailed information on project states (successful, failed, canceled, etc.), launch dates, categories, goals, pledges, and other relevant factors. The objective is to uncover valuable patterns that can inform future project creators and investors about the critical factors associated with success on the Kickstarter platform.

### Key Analytical Focus Areas:
1. **Project Outcome Distribution**: This analysis examines the percentage of projects categorized by their outcome (successful, failed, live, etc.) to better understand the general distribution of project results.

2. **Backer Participation Across Countries**: By analyzing the total number of backers by country, the study identifies the country with the highest and lowest overall backer participation, revealing regional differences in crowdfunding engagement.

3. **Trends in Project Launches Over Time**: This analysis identifies trends in project launches over the years, providing insights into how activity on the platform has evolved.

4. **Financial Insights by Category and Country**: The study identifies the countries with the highest average project goals within each category, highlighting regional variations in funding expectations across different sectors.

5. **Category Success Rates by Country**: The analysis focuses on identifying the highest success rates by category for each country, uncovering which regions demonstrate the strongest performance in particular crowdfunding categories.

6. **Earliest Successful Project with High Goals**: The earliest successful project with the highest goal is identified, offering a historical perspective on notable high-profile successes.

7. **Goal Completion Percentage by Category**: This part of the study calculates the average goal completion percentage (the ratio of pledged amount to the goal) for each category, focusing on projects with goals exceeding $1,000 that have successfully met their targets.

8. **Most Successful Categories by Year**: The study highlights the category with the highest percentage of success in each year, showcasing the evolving landscape of category-specific performance.
